/*
Advantages:
Follows Open/Closed Principle â†’ You can add new strategies without touching existing code.
Cleaner and more maintainable.
Each strategy is testable in isolation.

When to Use:
When you have multiple ways to do the same operation.
When you want to avoid a big if-else / switch.
When the algorithm might change at runtime.
